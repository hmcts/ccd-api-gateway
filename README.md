### Install dependencies

The project uses [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

To install dependencies please execute the following command:

```bash
yarn install
```

### Running

Simply run:

```
yarn start
```

to start the API gateway on [http://localhost:3453](http://localhost:3453).

#### Docker

If you want your code to become available to other Docker projects (e.g. for local environment testing), you need to build the image:

```bash
docker-compose build
```

You can run it by executing following command:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

As a result, the API gateway will be started and made available on port `3453`.

## Integration tests

The integration tests are mavenized and can be run using:

```bash
yarn integration
```
