This can cause malformed URLs to be evaluated in unexpected ways by common redirect allow list implementations in Express applications, leading to an Open Redirect via bypass of a properly implemented allow list.\n\nThe main method impacted is `res.location()` but this is also called from within `res.redirect()`.\n\n### Patches\n\nhttps://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0867302ddbde0e9463d0564fea5861feb708c2dd\nhttps://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0b746953c4bd8e377123527db11f9cd866e39f94\n\nAn initial fix went out with `express@4.19.0`, we then patched a feature regression in `4.19.1` and added improved handling for the bypass in `4.19.2`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe fix for this involves pre-parsing the url string with either `require('node:url').parse` or `new URL`. These are steps you can take on your own before passing the user input string to `res.location` or `res.redirect`.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://github.com/expressjs/express/pull/5539\nhttps://github.com/koajs/koa/issues/1800\nhttps://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.location","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rv95-896h-c2vc"},"1098094":{"findings":[{"version":"3.0.2","paths":["http-proxy-middleware>micromatch>braces"]}],"metadata":null,"vulnerable_versions":"<3.0.3","module_name":"braces","severity":"high","github_advisory_id":"GHSA-grv7-fg5c-xmjg","cves":["CVE-2024-4068"],"access":"public","patched_versions":">=3.0.3","cvss":{"score":7.5,"vectorString":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"},"updated":"2024-07-05T21:25:08.000Z","recommendation":"Upgrade to version 3.0.3 or later","cwe":["CWE-400","CWE-1050"],"found_by":null,"deleted":null,"id":1098094,"references":"- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-4068\n- https://github.com/micromatch/braces/issues/35\n- https://devhub.checkmarx.com/cve-details/CVE-2024-4068\n- https://github.com/micromatch/braces/blob/98414f9f1fabe021736e26836d8306d5de747e0d/lib/parse.js#L308\n- https://github.com/micromatch/braces/pull/37\n- https://github.com/micromatch/braces/pull/40\n- https://github.com/micromatch/braces/commit/415d660c3002d1ab7e63dbf490c9851da80596ff\n- https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-grv7-fg5c-xmjg","created":"2024-05-14T18:30:54.000Z","reported_by":null,"title":"Uncontrolled resource consumption in braces","npm_advisory_id":null,"overview":"The NPM package `braces` fails to limit the number of characters it can handle, which could lead to Memory Exhaustion.
