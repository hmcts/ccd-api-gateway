This can cause malformed URLs to be evaluated in unexpected ways by common redirect allow list implementations in Express applications, leading to an Open Redirect via bypass of a properly implemented allow list.\n\nThe main method impacted is `res.location()` but this is also called from within `res.redirect()`.\n\n### Patches\n\nhttps://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0867302ddbde0e9463d0564fea5861feb708c2dd\nhttps://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0b746953c4bd8e377123527db11f9cd866e39f94\n\nAn initial fix went out with `express@4.19.0`, we then patched a feature regression in `4.19.1` and added improved handling for the bypass in `4.19.2`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe fix for this involves pre-parsing the url string with either `require('node:url').parse` or `new URL`. These are steps you can take on your own before passing the user input string to `res.location` or `res.redirect`.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://github.com/expressjs/express/pull/5539\nhttps://github.com/koajs/koa/issues/1800\nhttps://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.location","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rv95-896h-c2vc"},"1096836":{"findings":[{"version":"1.15.2","paths":["http-proxy-middleware>http-proxy>follow-redirects"]}],"metadata":null,"vulnerable_versions":"<=1.15.5","module_name":"follow-redirects","severity":"moderate","github_advisory_id":"GHSA-cxjh-pqwp-8mfp","cves":["CVE-2024-28849"],"access":"public","patched_versions":">=1.15.6","cvss":{"score":6.5,"vectorString":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"},"updated":"2024-04-01T05:01:29.000Z","recommendation":"Upgrade to version 1.15.6 or later","cwe":["CWE-200"],"found_by":null,"deleted":null,"id":1096836,"references":"- https://github.com/follow-redirects/follow-redirects/security/advisories/GHSA-cxjh-pqwp-8mfp\n- https://github.com/follow-redirects/follow-redirects/commit/c4f847f85176991f95ab9c88af63b1294de8649b\n- https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#authentication-entries\n- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-28849\n- https://github.com/psf/requests/issues/1885\n- https://hackerone.com/reports/2390009\n- https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VOIF4EPQUCKDBEVTGRQDZ3CGTYQHPO7Z\n- https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cxjh-pqwp-8mfp","created":"2024-03-14T17:19:42.000Z","reported_by":null,"title":"follow-redirects' Proxy-Authorization header kept across hosts","npm_advisory_id":null,"overview":"When using axios, its dependency library follow-redirects only clears authorization header during cross-domain redirect, but allows the proxy-authentication header which contains credentials too.\n\nSteps To Reproduce & PoC\n\naxios Test Code\n\nconst axios = require('axios');\n\naxios.get('http://127.0.0.1:10081/',{\n    headers: {\n        'AuThorization': 'Rear Test',\n        'ProXy-AuthoriZation': 'Rear Test',\n        'coOkie': 't=1'\n    }\n    }).then(function (response) {\n        console.log(response);\n})\nWhen I meet the cross-domain redirect, the sensitive headers like authorization and cookie are cleared, but proxy-authentication header is kept.\n\nRequest sent by axios\n\nimage-20240314130755052.png\nRequest sent by follow-redirects after redirectimage-20240314130809838.png\n\nImpact\n\nThis vulnerability may lead to credentials leak.\n\nRecommendations\n\nRemove proxy-authentication header during cross-domain redirect\nRecommended Patch\n\nfollow-redirects/index.js:464\n\nremoveMatchingHeaders(/^(?:authorization|cookie)$/i, this._options.headers);\nchange to\n\nremoveMatchingHeaders(/^(?:authorization|proxy-authorization|cookie)$/i, this._options.headers);\nRef\n\nhttps://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#authentication-entries\nhttps://hackerone.com/reports/2390009","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cxjh-pqwp-8mfp"}},"muted":[],"metadata":{"vulnerabilities":{"info":0,"low":0,"moderate":3,"high":0,"critical":0},"dependencies":314,"devDependencies":1,"optionalDependencies":0,"totalDependencies":315}}
