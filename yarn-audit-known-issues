For example, `serialize(\"userName=<script>alert('XSS3')</script>; Max-Age=2592000; a\", value)` would result in `\"userName=<script>alert('XSS3')</script>; Max-Age=2592000; a=test\"`, setting `userName` cookie to `<script>` and ignoring `value`.\n\nA similar escape can be used for `path` and `domain`, which could be abused to alter other fields of the cookie.\n\n### Patches\n\nUpgrade to 0.7.0, which updates the validation for `name`, `path`, and `domain`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAvoid passing untrusted or arbitrary values for these fields, ensure they are set by the application instead of user input.\n\n### References\n\n* https://github.com/jshttp/cookie/pull/167","reported_by":null,"title":"cookie accepts cookie name, path, and domain with out of bounds characters","metadata":null,"cves":["CVE-2024-47764"],"access":"public","severity":"low","module_name":"cookie","vulnerable_versions":"<0.7.0","github_advisory_id":"GHSA-pxg6-pf52-xh8x","recommendation":"Upgrade to version 0.7.0 or later","patched_versions":">=0.7.0","updated":"2024-10-04T20:31:01.000Z","cvss":{"score":0,"vectorString":null},"cwe":["CWE-74"],"url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pxg6-pf52-xh8x"},"1100223":{"findings":[{"version":"0.20.0","paths":["http-proxy-middleware"]}],"found_by":null,"deleted":null,"references":"- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21536\n- https://github.com/chimurai/http-proxy-middleware/commit/0b4274e8cc9e9a2c5a06f35fbf456ccfcebc55a5\n- https://github.com/chimurai/http-proxy-middleware/commit/788b21e4aff38332d6319557d4a5b1b13b1f9a22\n- https://gist.github.com/mhassan1/28be67266d82a53708ed59ce5dc3c94a\n- https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-HTTPPROXYMIDDLEWARE-8229906\n- https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c7qv-q95q-8v27","created":"2024-10-19T06:30:30.000Z","id":1100223,"npm_advisory_id":null,"overview":"Versions of the package http-proxy-middleware before 2.0.7, from 3.0.0 and before 3.0.3 are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) due to an UnhandledPromiseRejection error thrown by micromatch.
