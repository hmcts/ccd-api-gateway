It's likely that you do not directly depend on `@babel/helpers`, and instead you depend on `@babel/core` (which itself depends on `@babel/helpers`). Upgrading to `@babel/core` 7.26.10 is not required, but it guarantees that you are on a new enough `@babel/helpers` version.\n\nPlease note that just updating your Babel dependencies is not enough: you will also need to re-compile your code.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you are passing user-provided strings as the second argument of `.replace` on regular expressions that contain named capturing groups, validate the input and make sure it does not contain the substring `$<` if it's then not followed by `>` (possibly with other characters in between).\n\n### References\n\nThis vulnerability was reported and fixed in https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/17173.","reported_by":null,"title":"Babel has inefficient RexExp complexity in generated code with .replace when transpiling named capturing groups","metadata":null,"cves":["CVE-2025-27789"],"access":"public","severity":"moderate","module_name":"@babel/helpers","vulnerable_versions":"<7.26.10","github_advisory_id":"GHSA-968p-4wvh-cqc8","recommendation":"Upgrade to version 7.26.10 or later","patched_versions":">=7.26.10","updated":"2025-03-12T14:48:10.000Z","cvss":{"score":6.2,"vectorString":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"},"cwe":["CWE-1333"],"url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-968p-4wvh-cqc8"}},"muted":[],"metadata":{"vulnerabilities":{"info":0,"low":0,"moderate":1,"high":0,"critical":0},"dependencies":314,"devDependencies":1,"optionalDependencies":0,"totalDependencies":315}}
